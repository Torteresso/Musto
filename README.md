PRESENTATION
============

TUSMO is my version of the famous French game motus, using my [physics engine](https://github.com/Torteresso/First-Physics-Engine).

Current state : 

- ability to change lots of parameters in the configuration.h file.
- ability to play with different word lenght and number of tries
- cool physics effects

# Controls :

<pre>
- ARROWS to naviguate in the menus
- ENTER to validate a guess
- LETTERS to make a guess
</pre>

HOW TO USE IT
=============

If you want to test it, you should download:  

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)

And then you can clone it in Visual Studio Community 2022. That's it ! :)
